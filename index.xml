SILENCE Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling conversation.
ORDER Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time.
RESOLUTION Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve.
FRUGALITY Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself; i.e., waste nothing.
INDUSTRY Lose no time; be always employâ€™d in something useful; cut off all unnecessary actions.</description></item></channel></rss>
